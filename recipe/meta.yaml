  summary: Efficient binary storage of ML models
  description: |
    The binpickle module uses Pickle Protocol 5 to enable efficient serialization of
    Scientific Python models, such as those learned by scikit-learn, to disk in with
    their large arrays either compressed (optionall with Blosc) or configured for
    memory-mapped use to support shared memory multiprocessing.
